Inheritance and Method Overriding in C# BY showing how the 'Dog' and 'Cat' classes override the 'Makesound()' method from the 'Animak class to exhibit polymorphism


Abstract Classes and Methods were demonstrated by implementing the 'Shape' class's abstract 'getArea()' method in the 'Circle' and 'Rectangle' classes, highlighting abstraction. 



Interfaces: shows interfaces in C# by having the 'Car' and 'Bicycle' classes implement the 'IMovable interface's 'Move()' method, illustrating how interfaces define a common method for different implementation.
